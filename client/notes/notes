# Survival Phase Game Design

## 1. Initial Disaster Stage

### Components:
- Disaster Type (e.g., Earthquake, Flood, Zombie Plague)
- Player's Starting Location (Home, Work, etc.)
- Immediate Challenges

### Gameplay:
1. Randomly select a disaster type
2. Determine player's starting location
3. Present immediate challenges based on disaster and location
4. Player must make decisions to survive initial impact

### Example Scenarios:
- Earthquake: "The ground is shaking violently. Do you:
  a) Take cover under a sturdy desk
  b) Run outside
  c) Try to grab supplies before taking cover"
- Zombie Plague: "Infected individuals are attacking people in the streets. Do you:
  a) Barricade yourself in your current location
  b) Try to make it to a vehicle
  c) Attempt to reach a loved one's location"

## 2. Access to Resources Stage

### Components:
- Travel Challenges
- Resource Retrieval

### Gameplay:
1. If player is not at home, they must navigate to their primary resource cache
2. Present travel challenges based on the disaster type
3. Player must make decisions on how to overcome obstacles

### Example Scenarios:
- "The roads are blocked with debris. Do you:
  a) Attempt to clear a path (requires time and energy)
  b) Find an alternative route (takes longer but safer)
  c) Abandon your vehicle and proceed on foot"

## 3. Survival Challenges Stage

### Components:
- Random Events
- Resource Management
- Health Management
- Social Interactions

### Gameplay:
1. Present daily or periodic challenges
2. Player must use resources, skills, and make decisions to overcome challenges
3. Track resource depletion, health status, and social relationships

### Example Scenarios:
- "You hear a cry for help nearby. Do you:
  a) Investigate and potentially assist
  b) Ignore it to conserve resources
  c) Call out to see if they come to you"
- "Your water supply is running low. Do you:
  a) Ration your remaining water
  b) Try to find a new water source
  c) Use your water purification skills on a questionable source"

## 4. Long-term Survival Stage

### Components:
- Community Building
- Long-term Resource Planning
- Potential Rescue or Evacuation Events

### Gameplay:
1. Present opportunities for forming alliances or building a community
2. Introduce long-term planning challenges (e.g., sustainable food sources)
3. Periodically present potential rescue scenarios

### Example Scenarios:
- "A group of survivors asks to join your camp. Do you:
  a) Welcome them and share resources
  b) Turn them away to conserve your supplies
  c) Allow them to stay but keep resources separate"
- "You receive a weak radio transmission about a rescue point 50 miles away. Do you:
  a) Stay put and wait for clearer information
  b) Prepare for a dangerous journey
  c) Try to boost your radio signal to get more info"

## Implementation Considerations:
1. Create a state machine to manage different stages of the Survival Phase
2. Implement a scenario system that can present situations and choices
3. Develop a resource management system that tracks supplies, health, and skills
4. Create an event generation system for random challenges and opportunities
5. Implement a scoring or progress tracking system to determine success or failure
