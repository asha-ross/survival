SURVIVAL

A story-telling game, focused on developing preparedness for natural (and unnatural) disasters. 

You wake on your day off, ready to relax. The sun is shining, and the day is yours!
But something starts to feel a bit off. To try to focus, you might organise your closet, clean your car, or go outside and mediate. Maybe it's time to talk to your neighbours, clear out your cellar, or perhaps you'll run to the shops and get a few more supplies. 
As you go about your day, suddenly, DISASTER STRIKES!
You are plunged into an unexpected natural (or unnatural!) disaster, and have to survive with just the equipment and skills you have on the day. 
How prepared are you? Can you help yourself, and others, get through the day?
